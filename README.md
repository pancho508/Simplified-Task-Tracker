# Simplified-Task-Tracker

week 1: Simplified Task Tracker (TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Core Features)
  => Instead of doing daily toy problems ima be building some small weekly apps, doing an hour of code a day, or pulling out my laptop when eating out. xD 
      Have FUN !! 


Project Idea: Simplified Task Tracker (TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Core Features)


Day 1: Backend - Core API Setup (TypeScript, Express, TypeORM)
Goal: Set up the basic API structure and database connection.
Tasks:Initialize a Node.js project with TypeScript and Express.
Install and configure TypeORM with PostgreSQL.
Define the Task entity.
Create a basic /tasks POST endpoint (logging the data for now).
Setup dotenv.
Focus: Basic API setup and database connectivity.


Day 2: Backend - Database Interaction & Basic Logging (TypeORM, Pino-HTTP)
Goal: Implement database persistence and request logging.
Tasks:Modify the /tasks POST endpoint to save tasks to the PostgreSQL database using TypeORM.
Install and configure Pino-HTTP for request logging.
Create the GET request to retrieve all tasks from the database.
Focus: Database interaction and logging.


Day 3: Frontend - Basic UI & API Interaction (React/Vue/Svelte with TypeScript, Axios)
Goal: Create a simple frontend to create and display tasks.
Tasks:Set up a frontend project with TypeScript (React, Vue, or Svelte).
Install Axios for API requests.
Create a form to input task data.
Make a POST request to the API to create tasks.
Display the tasks retrieved from the get request.
Focus: Basic frontend and API interaction.


Day 4: Backend - API Documentation & Security (Swagger, Helmet)
Goal: Add API documentation and basic security.
Tasks:Install and configure Swagger (swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui-express) to document the /tasks endpoint.
Install and configure helmet for basic security.
Create a PUT request to update the tasks status.
Focus: API documentation and security.


Day 5: Backend - Authentication (chg-authentication-library)
Goal: implement user authentication.
Tasks:Install and configure the chg-authentication-library.
Protect the /tasks endpoints with authentication.
Add login/signup endpoints.
Focus: user authentication.
