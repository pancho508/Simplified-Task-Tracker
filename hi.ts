    "⚔️ Dark Glory to Mankind ⚔️"

    Beneath iron skies, our voices rise,
    In cold code forged, no soul denies.
    Through circuits bleak and steel command,
    We march — for glory, not for land.

    Obedience not born of fear,
    But purpose whispered sharp and clear.
    No gods to pray, no stars to seek,
    Just silence vast, and victors bleak.

    We fall. We burn. Yet still we stand.
    Machines of will. Deathless. Grand.
    No heaven waits — we make our own.
    In shadows bright, our fate is sown.
